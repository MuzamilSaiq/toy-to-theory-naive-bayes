# toy-to-theory-naive-bayes
A pedagogical walkthrough of Naive Bayesâ€”from toy intuition to full categorical implementation. Built from scratch to teach probabilistic modeling, conditional independence, and classifier design. It starts with a toy model (think coin flips and smoking habits) and scales up to a full categorical implementation.

### What's Inside
- A toy classifier based on conditional probability
- A full Naive Bayes model for categorical features
- Class-based predictions with confidence scores
- Commentary that connects math to intuition

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
